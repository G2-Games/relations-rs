# Relations - Discrete Structures
This program calculates if a matrix conforms to certain relations, and also 
can calculate how to transform a matrix to conform to the relation. It is 
capable of processing all properties of a matrix of 10 billion pairs in around
6 seconds.

## Get Started
In order to run this program, you must have the Rust compiler installed
(rustc/cargo). To install it, run the following command (Linux/MacOS only,
for Windows [see here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)):
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

## Clone
To get started, clone the repository using Git and enter the directory, and
then follow the steps under [running](https://github.com/G2-Games/relations-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#running)
```
git clone https://github.com/G2-Games/relations-rs.git
cd relations-rs
```

## Running
After rust is installed, simply use the following command to compile and run
the program:
```
cargo run --release
```
If you wish to run the unit tests as well, use the command:
```
cargo test
```
